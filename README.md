# Exercism Foo

Started using [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) about 18 months ago to learn some [Golang](https://golang.org/) and then stopped, cuz ... __[SQUIRREL](http://www.quoteslike.com/images/2354/the-10-best-images-from-the-call-me-maybe-meme-ivmpRo-quote.jpg)__.

Finally back at it, but now practicing with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) because I've been writing a lot more Ruby than anything else as of late, thanks to [Chef](https://www.chef.io/). Still wildly curious about Go though so expect to get back to that when time permits.

For those who've not tried [Exercism](http://exercism.io/), I can't recommend it highly enough.  Seriously, these problems will keep/make your brain sharp and sorta feel like a coder's equivalent to the morning crossword puzzle... or maybe that's just me.
